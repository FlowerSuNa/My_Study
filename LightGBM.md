### Abstract

* But the efficiency and scalability are stil unsatisfactory when 
  * the feature dimension is high
  * data size is large
  
* Reason

### Introduction

* Gradient Boosting Decision Tree [(GBDT)](Gradient_Boosting.md)
  * a widely-used machine learning algorithm, due to its efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability
  * a few effective implementations such as XGBoost and pGBRT
