### Abstract

* But the efficiency and scalability are stil unsatisfactory when 
  * the feature dimension is high
  * data size is large


<br>

## Introduction

* **Gradient Boosting Decision Tree** [(GBDT)](Gradient_Boosting.md)
  * a widely-used machine learning algorithm, due to its efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability
  * state-of-the-art-performances in many machine learning tasks
  
<br>

**Need to**, <br>
for every feature, scan all the data instances to estimate the information gain of all the possible split points. <br>
(very time consuming when handling big data)

<br>

### Is it a good idea to reduce the number of data instances and features?

<br> . <br> . <br> . <br> 

### NO!
