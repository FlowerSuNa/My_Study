# Gradient Boosting

> Can a set of weak learners create a single strong learner?

Boosting is a machine learning ensemble meta-algorithm for primarily reducing bias, and also variance in supervised learning, 
and a family of machine learning algorithms that convert weak learners to strong ones.


**Gradient Boosting** is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, 
which produces a prediction model in the form of an **ensemble** of weak prediction models, typically **decision trees**.
